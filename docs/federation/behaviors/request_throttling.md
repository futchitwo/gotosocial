# Request Throttling and Rate Limiting

GoToSocial applies rate limiting and http request throttling to the ActivityPub API endpoints (inboxes, user endpoints, emojis, etc). For more details on this, please see the [throttling](../../api/throttling.md) and [rate limiting](../../api/ratelimiting.md) documents.
