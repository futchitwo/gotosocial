# Code of Conduct

This document is currently a stub.

In lieu of a fuller code of conduct, here are a few ground rules.

1. We *DO NOT ACCEPT* PRs from right-wingers, Nazis, transphobes, homophobes, racists, harassers, abusers, white-supremacists, misogynists, tech-bros of questionable ethics. If that's you, politely fuck off somewhere else.
2. Any PR that moves GoToSocial in the direction of surveillance capitalism or other bad fediverse behavior will be rejected.
3. Don't spam the general chat too hard.
